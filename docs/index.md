This tracker is intended to be used with PointCrow's Universal Warp Randomiser.

## Downloading
Download and run `LPTSetup.exe` from the most recent release on the [Releases](https://github.com/shmove/LeahsPlatinumTracker/releases) page, then subsequently launch from the desktop icon.

## Features
This tracker has the ability to:
- Link and mark all warps in Pokémon Platinum.
- Keep track of player checks.
- Display which areas are inaccessible, unlocked or fully checked, taking into account the player's checks to know what is/isn't currently accessible.

## Usage
Areas can be navigated by clicking between their associated buttons from the top and right hand sections for locations and routes respectively.	<br />

<b>Colour coding</b>
- *Grey* areas are considered inaccessible to the player.
- *Blue* areas contain warps that haven't been checked yet.
- *Yellow* areas contain warps blocked by a Check-Lock marker.
- *Green* areas are considered fully checked for what is currently accessible.
- *Darker green* areas signify an area that is completely checked of all of its warps.

<b>Linking</b>
- Each warp can be linked by selecting it, clicking the link button and then selecting another warp. Linked warps can be middle-clicked on to instantly load their destination page. <br />
- Each warp can also be given a marker by selecting it and choosing a marker from the left hand side, or simply right clicking to mark the warp as a dead end.

<b>Markers</b>
- Markers selected from the upper section are considered as 'Check-Locks' to the tracker, and an area won't display as completed unless the associated warps are linked, or have their markers changed to one from the lower section.

<b>Checks</b>
- Checks are managed by clicking / right clicking on their icons in the bottom left. 
- Right clicking marks a check as discovered, but doesn't consider it usable in terms of tracking. <em>(for example, in Pokémon Platinum; marking Surf and Gym 5 as discovered won't unlock any sections of the map, but once they are both marked as unlocked, sections blocked by a Surf check will open up.)</em>
